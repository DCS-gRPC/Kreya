# DCS-gRPC Kreya project

Kreya is a GUI that makes it easy to explore gRPC APIs. Please
see https://kreya.app/docs/getting-started/ for information on
downloading and using the application.

Once you have done so please open the `project/DCS-gRPC.krproj`
to begin exploring.

This project has been setup such that you can re-run the kreya
importer to refresh the APIs to their default values; this is
useful in case you accidentally delete or change the default
generated APIs.
